# DESCRIPTION

Beam::Wire::Moose is a subclass of Beam::Wire that adds support for Moose-specific
features.

# NAME

Beam::Wire::Moose - Dependency Injection with extra Moose features

# SERVICE CONFIG

## with

Compose roles into this object at run-time. This creates an anonymous class that
extends the `class` config and consumes the roles defined by `with`.

NOTE: This means the service is not an instance of `class` but an instance of
a class that inherits from `class`. Be cautious when using `ref` and
`Scalar::Util::blessed`.
